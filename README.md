## Project Introduction

“Refugee” is still one of the most common words we heard in geopolitical news, even though we are living in a relatively peaceful era. When watching the news about refugees, people are impressed by the sadness that refugees lost their homelands and the pain that they suffered as looking for the asylums. However, only a few people would think of the stress from the countries providing asylums. n a gesture of humanity, many European countries generously open their door and provide asylum for refugees all over the world. In 2015, more than 1.3 million refugees came to the continent to request asylum, which is the most year after World War II. Not only the financial pressure, but the differences in terms of culture and religion between refugees and local residents are also challenging the governments of European countries. Additionally, the situations of refugees from conflicts in Europe such as Ukraine and the Balkans, who also face similar struggles, have been largely ignored, as they are often seen as being from "first-world" countries.

In this project, we will be focusing on two groups of refugees in 21st-century Europe. The first group consists of refugees looking for asylums in Europe, and the second group comprises refugees from European countries who have settled all over the world. Our analysis will include an overview of the origin countries and asylum countries of the refugees, as well as demographic data such as age and gender. We will also investigate the application and approval rates of the refugees seeking asylum in Europe. Furthermore, we will concentrate on a specific conflict that has generated significant refugee populations: the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. 

## Summary

This project explores refugee-related issues through data analysis and visualization of relevant refugee data. It examines the number of refugees moving between different continents, the proportion of refugee flows, and the situation of people of different genders seeking asylum in different countries. Additionally, it analyzes the refugee acceptance rate across different continents, the impact of GDP on refugee numbers in different regions, and the situation of refugee flows in Ukraine and Russia. Through these analyses, the project aims to shed light on important refugee-related issues and promote a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by refugees around the world.
